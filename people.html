								Chujun joined the Department of Psychology at UCSD as an assistant professor in July 2023. She obtained her Ph.D. in social science at the California Institute of Technology in 2019, and completed her postdoctoral training in social psychology at Dartmouth College in 2023. Chujun's work focuses on how people infer others’ enduring traits via both dubious shortcuts (e.g. faces) and meaningful signals (e.g., emotions), and how biases in these trait inferences impact consequential real-world decisions (e.g., in politics, media, and science). When not science-ing, Chujun enjoys rock climbing, hiking, and singing.  <br>
